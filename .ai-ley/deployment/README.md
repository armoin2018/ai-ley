## Getting Started

### 1. Choose Your Template

Select the appropriate template based on your platform, use case, and complexity requirements using the guides above.

### 2. Copy Template Files

```bash
# Copy the desired template to your project
cp -r templates/deployment/[template-name]/* ./deployment/

# Make scripts executable (Unix/Linux)
chmod +x deployment/scripts/*.sh
```

### 3. Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy and edit configuration files
cp deployment/config/development.conf.example deployment/config/development.conf
vim deployment/config/development.conf
```

### 4. Test Deployment

```bash
# Run a dry-run first
./deployment/deploy.sh development --dry-run

# Deploy to development
./deployment/deploy.sh development
```

### 5. Production Preparation

```bash
# Configure production environment
cp deployment/config/production.conf.example deployment/config/production.conf

# Test with staging first
./deployment/deploy.sh staging

# Deploy to production with backup
./deployment/deploy.sh production --backup
```

## Template Customization

### Adding Custom Steps

Each template includes hooks for custom logic:

- **Pre-deployment hooks**: `hooks/pre-deploy.*`
- **Post-deployment hooks**: `hooks/post-deploy.*`
- **Custom validation**: `validation/custom-checks.*`
- **Environment-specific overrides**: `config/[environment].*`

### Extending Templates

Templates are designed to be modular and extensible:

1. **Add new services**: Extend service management modules
2. **Custom health checks**: Implement application-specific validation
3. **Integration points**: Add monitoring, logging, and alerting
4. **Security enhancements**: Implement additional security measures

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Test locally first**: Use development environment for initial testing
2. **Validate changes**: Run dry-run mode before actual deployment
3. **Incremental deployment**: Deploy to staging before production
4. **Monitor closely**: Watch logs and metrics during deployment
5. **Have rollback ready**: Always test rollback procedures

### Production Deployment

1. **Create backups**: Always backup before production deployment
2. **Maintenance windows**: Schedule deployments during low-traffic periods
3. **Gradual rollout**: Use blue-green or canary deployment strategies
4. **Health monitoring**: Implement comprehensive health checks
5. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders of deployment status

### Security Considerations

1. **Secrets management**: Never commit plain text secrets
2. **Access control**: Implement least privilege principles
3. **Network security**: Use firewalls and network segmentation
4. **Audit logging**: Log all deployment activities
5. **Compliance**: Follow organizational security policies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Permission Errors

```bash
# Fix file permissions
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Fix directory permissions
chmod -R 755 deployment/
```

#### Network Connectivity

```bash
# Test connectivity
ping target-server
telnet target-server 22

# Check firewall rules
iptables -L (Linux)
netsh advfirewall show allprofiles (Windows)
```

#### Service Failures

```bash
# Check service logs
journalctl -u service-name (systemd)
systemctl status service-name

# Check application logs
tail -f /var/log/application.log
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check logs**: Review deployment logs for error details
2. **Validate configuration**: Ensure all configuration files are correct
3. **Test connectivity**: Verify network connectivity to target systems
4. **Review prerequisites**: Confirm all dependencies are installed
5. **Consult documentation**: Reference template-specific README files

## Contributing

To contribute new templates or improvements:

1. **Follow template structure**: Use consistent directory layout and naming
2. **Include documentation**: Provide comprehensive README and examples
3. **Add AI integration**: Include model recommendations and persona mappings
4. **Test thoroughly**: Validate across multiple environments
5. **Update main README**: Add your template to the selection guides

## Integration with Build-Plan-Run Workflow

These deployment templates integrate seamlessly with the build-plan-run workflow:

1. **Planning Phase**: Use templates to estimate deployment complexity and resource requirements
2. **Architecture Phase**: Reference templates when designing deployment architecture
3. **Execution Phase**: Use intelligent model selection to choose optimal templates
4. **Optimization Phase**: Analyze deployment metrics and improve template configurations
