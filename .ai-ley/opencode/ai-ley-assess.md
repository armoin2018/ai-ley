## Assessment Process

### 1. Content Discovery

- Scans specified content directories for .md files
- Parses existing YAML frontmatter and current scores
- Identifies files requiring assessment updates

### 2. Quality Evaluation

Four-dimensional assessment framework:

- **Template Compliance (25%)**: Adherence to required structure and format
- **Content Quality (25%)**: Information depth, accuracy, and comprehensiveness
- **Clarity & Usability (25%)**: Readability, actionability, and user experience
- **Professional Standards (25%)**: Writing quality, organization, presentation

### 3. Scoring System

0-5 scale with 0.5 increments:

- **5.0**: Exceptional - Perfect compliance, production-ready
- **4.5**: High quality - Strong compliance, minor improvements
- **4.0**: Good - Adequate compliance, some enhancements needed
- **3.5**: Moderate - Partial compliance, several gaps
- **3.0**: Basic - Limited compliance, major improvements needed
- **2.5-0.5**: Below standard - Significant reconstruction required
- **0.0**: Empty/non-functional - Complete reconstruction needed

### 4. File Updates

- Updates `summaryScore` field in YAML frontmatter
- Preserves all other metadata fields
- Updates `lastUpdated` timestamp for significant score changes (>0.5)

### 5. Improvement Reporting
