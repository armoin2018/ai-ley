# Agents Index

This index will provide a comprehensive catalog of all AI agents in the AI-LEY knowledge base.
Last updated: 2025-11-10T00:00:00Z

## Status

**No agent files currently exist in the AI-LEY knowledge base.**

The `.ai-ley/shared/agents/` directory was scanned and no agent definition files were found.

## Future Structure

When agents are created, this index will follow the same format as other AI-LEY indexes:

| Path             | Keywords | Description | Quality |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| (No entries yet) |          |             |         |

## Agent System Planning

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Define agent architecture**: Determine how agents differ from personas and prompts
2. **Create agent template**: Develop standardized template for agent definitions
3. **Establish directory structure**: Organize agents by category or function
4. **Set quality criteria**: Define what makes a high-quality agent
5. **Create first agents**: Build initial agent examples following template

### Potential Agent Categories

Based on AI-LEY system patterns, future agents might be organized as:

- **Automation Agents**: Task orchestration and workflow execution
- **Analysis Agents**: Code review, quality assessment, security scanning
- **Development Agents**: Code generation, refactoring, testing
- **Documentation Agents**: Technical writing, API documentation, diagrams
- **Integration Agents**: External system connectors, data ingestion
- **Monitoring Agents**: Health checks, performance tracking, alerts

### Integration with Existing Assets

Agents will likely integrate with:

- **Prompts**: Execute prompt sequences and workflows
- **Instructions**: Follow technical guidelines for specialized tasks
- **Personas**: Adopt communication styles and expertise domains
- **Templates**: Generate content following standardized formats
