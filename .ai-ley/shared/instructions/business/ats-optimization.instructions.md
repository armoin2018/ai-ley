```

### ATS-Friendly Format Guidelines

```yaml
# ATS Document Structure Best Practices
format_requirements:
  file_types:
    preferred: ['.docx', '.pdf']
    avoid: ['.jpg', '.png', '.html', '.pages']

  structure:
    sections:
      - 'Contact Information'
      - 'Professional Summary'
      - 'Core Competencies/Skills'
      - 'Professional Experience'
      - 'Education'
      - 'Certifications'

    formatting:
      fonts: ['Arial', 'Calibri', 'Times New Roman']
      font_size: '10-12pt'
      margins: '0.5-1 inch'
      bullet_points: 'simple bullets only'
      tables: 'avoid complex tables'
      graphics: 'avoid images, charts, logos'
```

## Common Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Resume ATS Optimization

**When**: Job seekers need to optimize their resume for specific job applications

### Analysis Patterns

```python
# ATS Keyword Analysis Example
def analyze_ats_compatibility(resume_text, job_description):
    """
    Analyze resume ATS compatibility against job requirements
    """

    # Extract keywords from job description
    job_keywords = extract_keywords(job_description)

    # Analyze resume content
    resume_analysis = {
        'keyword_matches': find_keyword_matches(resume_text, job_keywords),
        'keyword_density': calculate_keyword_density(resume_text, job_keywords),
        'format_score': assess_format_compatibility(resume_text),
        'section_structure': validate_section_structure(resume_text)
    }

    # Generate optimization recommendations
    recommendations = generate_optimization_tips(resume_analysis, job_keywords)

    return {
        'compatibility_score': calculate_overall_score(resume_analysis),
        'recommendations': recommendations,
        'missing_keywords': identify_missing_keywords(resume_text, job_keywords),
        'format_issues': identify_format_issues(resume_text)
    }

def extract_keywords(job_description):
    """Extract relevant keywords from job description"""

    # Technical skills extraction
    technical_skills = extract_technical_skills(job_description)

    # Soft skills identification
    soft_skills = extract_soft_skills(job_description)

    # Industry-specific terms
    industry_terms = extract_industry_terms(job_description)

    # Required qualifications
    qualifications = extract_qualifications(job_description)

    return {
        'technical_skills': technical_skills,
        'soft_skills': soft_skills,
        'industry_terms': industry_terms,
        'qualifications': qualifications,
        'priority_keywords': rank_keywords_by_importance(job_description)
    }
```

### ATS Scoring Algorithm

```javascript
// ATS Compatibility Scoring System

  constructor() {
    this.weights = {
      keywordMatch: 0.35,
      formatCompliance: 0.25,
      sectionStructure: 0.2,
      readability: 0.15,
      contentQuality: 0.05,
    };
  }

  analyzeResume(resumeContent, jobRequirements) {
    const scores = {
      keywordMatch: this.analyzeKeywordMatch(resumeContent, jobRequirements),
      formatCompliance: this.analyzeFormat(resumeContent),
      sectionStructure: this.analyzeSections(resumeContent),
      readability: this.analyzeReadability(resumeContent),
      contentQuality: this.analyzeContentQuality(resumeContent),
    };

    const overallScore = this.calculateWeightedScore(scores);

    return {
      overallScore: overallScore,
      detailedScores: scores,
      recommendations: this.generateRecommendations(scores),
      optimizationPriority: this.prioritizeOptimizations(scores),
    };
  }

  analyzeKeywordMatch(resumeContent, jobRequirements) {
    const requiredKeywords = this.extractJobKeywords(jobRequirements);
    const resumeKeywords = this.extractResumeKeywords(resumeContent);

    const matches = requiredKeywords.filter((keyword) =>
      resumeKeywords.includes(keyword.toLowerCase()),
    );

    return {
      score: (matches.length / requiredKeywords.length) * 100,
      matchedKeywords: matches,
      missingKeywords: requiredKeywords.filter(
        (keyword) => !resumeKeywords.includes(keyword.toLowerCase()),
      ),
      recommendations: this.generateKeywordRecommendations(matches, requiredKeywords),
    };
  }
}
```
