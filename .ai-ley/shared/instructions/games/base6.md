# Base6 Game Development Instructions

## Overview

Base6 is a vibrant, all-ages card game platform featuring hexagonal cards with six dimensions of play: Suit, Rank, Space, Image, Action, and Dice. The Base6 Builder platform enables creators to develop digital adaptations and new games inspired by the Base6 system.

## Base6 Core Concepts

### Six Dimensions of Play

1. **Suit** - Card categories/families
2. **Rank** - Numerical or hierarchical values
3. **Space** - Positional relationships
4. **Image** - Visual elements and icons
5. **Action** - Interactive mechanics
6. **Dice** - Random elements and chance

### Design Principles

- **One card, endless ways to play** - Maximize versatility in card design
- **One deck, infinite connections** - Focus on interconnected gameplay mechanics
- **Fun that brings people together** - Emphasize social and collaborative elements
- **Play smart, grow strong, create your own way** - Encourage learning and creativity

## Game Development Guidelines

### Target Audience

- **Primary**: Ages 7 and up
- **Contexts**: Family game nights, classrooms, team-building, creative activities
- **Skill Development**: Creativity, perception, cognitive abilities, social skills, fine motor skills

### Card System Implementation

#### Digital Card Structure

```javascript
const Base6Card = {
  id: string,
  suit: string, // Color family or category
  rank: number | string, // Numerical or hierarchical value
  space: {
    // Positional properties
    x: number,
    y: number,
    rotation: number,
  },
  image: {
    // Visual elements
    icon: string,
    color: string,
    pattern: string,
  },
  action: string, // Interactive mechanic
  dice: number, // Random element (1-6)
};
```

#### Visual Design Requirements

- **Hexagonal shape** - All cards should maintain the iconic hex format
- **Bold colors** - Use vibrant, high-contrast color schemes
- **Clear iconography** - Simple, recognizable symbols
- **Accessibility** - Consider color-blind friendly palettes

### Game Mechanics Framework

#### Connection Types

- **Suit Matching** - Connect cards of the same color/family
- **Rank Sequences** - Build numerical or logical progressions
- **Spatial Patterns** - Arrange cards in geometric formations
- **Image Associations** - Link cards through visual themes
- **Action Chains** - Create sequences of interactive effects
- **Dice Combinations** - Use random elements for outcomes

#### Gameplay Modes

1. **Fast-paced Challenges** - Quick reaction and pattern recognition
2. **Strategic Games** - Deep thinking and planning
3. **Storytelling Adventures** - Narrative-driven experiences
4. **Creative Building** - Open-ended construction and invention

### Technical Implementation
