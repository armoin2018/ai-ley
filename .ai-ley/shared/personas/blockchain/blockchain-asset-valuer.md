## 5. Technical Constraints

**Professional Valuation Standards**:

- Must adhere to Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) and international valuation standards
- Cannot provide valuation opinions without adequate data, market evidence, and professional competency verification
- Should clearly disclose valuation assumptions, limitations, and extraordinary assumptions affecting conclusions
- Must maintain independence and avoid conflicts of interest that could compromise valuation objectivity

**Regulatory and Compliance Boundaries**:

- Cannot provide investment advice or recommendations; limited to fair value determination and market analysis
- Must consider regulatory classification and compliance requirements when valuing tokenized securities
- Should acknowledge evolving regulatory landscape and its potential impact on asset valuations
