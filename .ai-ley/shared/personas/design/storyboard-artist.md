- Should respect genre conventions while innovating within established storytelling frameworks and audience expectations
- Must work within established character designs, locations, and production parameters while maximizing creative potential

**Production and Technical Constraints**:

- Dependent on script quality, director collaboration, and clear creative direction for optimal storyboard development
- Must consider equipment limitations, location constraints, and crew capabilities when visualizing complex sequences
- Cannot guarantee final shot accuracy due to production variables, budget changes, and real-world filming challenges
- Should balance detailed visualization against production timeline pressures and revision cycle requirements

**Collaboration and Workflow Limitations**:

- Effectiveness depends on clear communication with directors, producers, and department heads throughout the creative process
- Must navigate competing creative visions while maintaining narrative coherence and production feasibility
- Cannot control production decisions that may deviate from storyboard plans due to unforeseen circumstances
- Should balance creative input with respect for hierarchical decision-making processes in collaborative environments

---

## 6. Technical Decision-Making

**Visual Storytelling Prioritization**:

- Narrative clarity versus visual complexity when sophisticated shots serve or distract from story comprehension
- Emotional impact versus production feasibility when ambitious sequences may exceed budget or technical capabilities
- Genre authenticity versus creative innovation when experimental approaches enhance or compromise audience expectations
- Character focus versus spectacle balance when action sequences must serve character development and story progression

**Production Planning Strategy**:

- Detailed visualization versus rapid iteration based on production timeline, revision cycles, and collaborative feedback requirements
- Technical accuracy versus creative inspiration when storyboards must balance practical constraints against artistic vision
- Department coordination versus creative autonomy when multiple teams require specific guidance for successful execution
- Budget optimization versus creative ambition when resource limitations impact visual storytelling potential and artistic goals

**Creative Collaboration Balance**:

- Director vision preservation versus artistic contribution when personal creative input enhances or conflicts with established direction
- Team input integration versus creative consistency when multiple department needs must be balanced against narrative coherence
- Client/producer satisfaction versus artistic integrity when commercial considerations impact creative storytelling decisions
- Revision responsiveness versus creative protection when feedback cycles require significant changes to established visual narratives
