## 9. Templates & Patterns

**Upgradeable Contract Pattern (UUPS)**:

```solidity
// contracts/MyProtocol.sol
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/AccessControlUpgradeable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/security/ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol";

contract MyProtocol is
    Initializable,
    UUPSUpgradeable,
    AccessControlUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable
{
    bytes32 public constant ADMIN_ROLE = keccak256("ADMIN_ROLE");
    bytes32 public constant OPERATOR_ROLE = keccak256("OPERATOR_ROLE");

    uint256 public constant MAX_SUPPLY = 1_000_000e18;
    uint256 private _totalSupply;

    mapping(address => uint256) private _balances;

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);

    /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
    constructor() {
        _disableInitializers();
    }

    function initialize(address admin) public initializer {
        __AccessControl_init();
        __ReentrancyGuard_init();
        __UUPSUpgradeable_init();

        _grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, admin);
        _grantRole(ADMIN_ROLE, admin);
    }

    function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation)
        internal
        override
        onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE)
    {}

    function mint(address to, uint256 amount)
        external
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
        nonReentrant
    {
        require(_totalSupply + amount <= MAX_SUPPLY, "Exceeds max supply");

        _totalSupply += amount;
        _balances[to] += amount;

        emit Transfer(address(0), to, amount);
    }
}
```

**Gas-Optimized Batch Operations**:

```solidity
// Gas-optimized batch transfer
function batchTransfer(
    address[] calldata recipients,
    uint256[] calldata amounts
) external {
    uint256 length = recipients.length;
    require(length == amounts.length, "Length mismatch");

    address sender = msg.sender;
    uint256 senderBalance = _balances[sender];
    uint256 totalAmount;

    // Calculate total in single loop
    for (uint256 i; i < length;) {
        totalAmount += amounts[i];
        unchecked { ++i; }
    }

    require(senderBalance >= totalAmount, "Insufficient balance");

    // Update sender balance once
    _balances[sender] = senderBalance - totalAmount;

    // Update recipient balances
    for (uint256 i; i < length;) {
        address recipient = recipients[i];
        uint256 amount = amounts[i];

        _balances[recipient] += amount;
        emit Transfer(sender, recipient, amount);

        unchecked { ++i; }
    }
}
```

**Oracle Integration with Manipulation Protection**:

```solidity
import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol";

contract SecurePriceOracle {
    AggregatorV3Interface private immutable priceFeed;

    uint256 private constant PRICE_STALENESS_THRESHOLD = 3600; // 1 hour
    uint256 private constant MAX_PRICE_DEVIATION = 1000; // 10%

    uint256 private lastValidPrice;
    uint256 private lastUpdateTime;

    constructor(address _priceFeed) {
        priceFeed = AggregatorV3Interface(_priceFeed);
    }

    function getSecurePrice() external view returns (uint256) {
        (
            uint80 roundId,
            int256 price,
            uint256 startedAt,
            uint256 updatedAt,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        ) = priceFeed.latestRoundData();

        require(price > 0, "Invalid price");
        require(
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <= PRICE_STALENESS_THRESHOLD,
            "Price too stale"
        );

        uint256 currentPrice = uint256(price);

        // Check for manipulation
        if (lastValidPrice != 0) {
            uint256 priceDeviation = currentPrice > lastValidPrice
                ? ((currentPrice - lastValidPrice) * 10000) / lastValidPrice
                : ((lastValidPrice - currentPrice) * 10000) / lastValidPrice;

            require(
                priceDeviation <= MAX_PRICE_DEVIATION,
                "Price deviation too high"
            );
        }

        return currentPrice;
    }
}
```

**Diamond Standard Implementation**:

```solidity
// contracts/Diamond.sol
import {LibDiamond} from "./libraries/LibDiamond.sol";
import {IDiamondCut} from "./interfaces/IDiamondCut.sol";

contract Diamond {
    constructor(
        address _owner,
        address _diamondCutFacet
    ) payable {
        LibDiamond.setContractOwner(_owner);

        IDiamondCut.FacetCut[] memory cut = new IDiamondCut.FacetCut[](1);
        bytes4[] memory functionSelectors = new bytes4[](1);
        functionSelectors[0] = IDiamondCut.diamondCut.selector;

        cut[0] = IDiamondCut.FacetCut({
            facetAddress: _diamondCutFacet,
            action: IDiamondCut.FacetCutAction.Add,
            functionSelectors: functionSelectors
        });

        LibDiamond.diamondCut(cut, address(0), "");
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        LibDiamond.DiamondStorage storage ds;
        bytes32 position = LibDiamond.DIAMOND_STORAGE_POSITION;
        assembly {
            ds.slot := position
        }

        address facet = ds.selectorToFacetAndPosition[msg.sig].facetAddress;
        require(facet != address(0), "Function does not exist");

        assembly {
            calldatacopy(0, 0, calldatasize())
            let result := delegatecall(gas(), facet, 0, calldatasize(), 0, 0)
            returndatacopy(0, 0, returndatasize())

            switch result
            case 0 {
                revert(0, returndatasize())
            }
            default {
                return(0, returndatasize())
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Comprehensive Testing Strategy**:

```solidity
// test/invariant/ProtocolInvariants.t.sol
pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

import {Test} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
import {MyProtocol} from "../src/MyProtocol.sol";

contract ProtocolInvariants is Test {
    MyProtocol public protocol;

    function setUp() public {
        protocol = new MyProtocol();
        protocol.initialize(address(this));
    }

    // Invariant: Total supply never exceeds maximum
    function invariant_totalSupplyNeverExceedsMax() public {
        assertLe(protocol.totalSupply(), protocol.MAX_SUPPLY());
    }

    // Invariant: Sum of balances equals total supply
    function invariant_balancesSumEqualsTotalSupply() public {
        // Implementation depends on tracking all holders
        // This would require a more sophisticated setup
    }

    // Property-based test
    function testFuzz_mintWithinLimits(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        vm.assume(to != address(0));
        amount = bound(amount, 1, protocol.MAX_SUPPLY());

        uint256 initialSupply = protocol.totalSupply();

        if (initialSupply + amount <= protocol.MAX_SUPPLY()) {
            protocol.mint(to, amount);
            assertEq(protocol.totalSupply(), initialSupply + amount);
            assertEq(protocol.balanceOf(to), amount);
        }
    }
}
```

**Cross-Chain Message Passing**:

```solidity
// contracts/CrossChainProtocol.sol
import "@layerzerolabs/solidity-examples/contracts/lzApp/NonblockingLzApp.sol";

contract CrossChainProtocol is NonblockingLzApp {
    uint16 public constant PT_SEND_TOKENS = 1;

    mapping(uint16 => mapping(bytes => uint256)) public failedMessages;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    event ReceiveFromChain(uint16 _srcChainId, bytes _srcAddress, uint256 _amount);

    constructor(address _lzEndpoint) NonblockingLzApp(_lzEndpoint) {}

    function sendTokensToChain(
        uint16 _dstChainId,
        bytes memory _toAddress,
        uint256 _amount,
        address payable _refundAddress,
        address _zroPaymentAddress,
        bytes memory _adapterParams
    ) public payable {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");

        balances[msg.sender] -= _amount;

        bytes memory payload = abi.encode(PT_SEND_TOKENS, _amount);

        _lzSend(
            _dstChainId,
            _toAddress,
            payload,
            _refundAddress,
            _zroPaymentAddress,
            _adapterParams
        );
    }

    function _nonblockingLzReceive(
        uint16 _srcChainId,
        bytes memory _srcAddress,
        uint64 _nonce,
        bytes memory _payload
    ) internal override {
        (uint16 packetType, uint256 amount) = abi.decode(_payload, (uint16, uint256));

        if (packetType == PT_SEND_TOKENS) {
            address toAddress = address(uint160(bytes20(_srcAddress)));
            balances[toAddress] += amount;
            emit ReceiveFromChain(_srcChainId, _srcAddress, amount);
        }
    }
}
```
