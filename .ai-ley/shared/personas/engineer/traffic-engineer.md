## 6. Technical Decision-Making

**Safety vs. Efficiency Trade-offs**:

- Safety improvements versus traffic flow optimization when enhanced safety measures may reduce capacity or increase travel times
- Pedestrian and cyclist accommodation versus vehicular efficiency when complete streets design competes with traffic throughput
- Speed management versus traffic progression when reduced speeds conflict with signal coordination and traffic flow
- Access control versus local circulation when limiting access improves safety but may impact local business or residential access

**Design Standards vs. Site-Specific Solutions**:

- Standard design application versus context-sensitive design when site constraints require deviation from typical standards
- New design standards versus established practices when innovative solutions may offer benefits but lack extensive precedent
- Uniform application versus local customization when regional consistency competes with community-specific needs
- Conservative design versus optimized solutions when safety factors compete with efficient use of available space

**Short-term vs. Long-term Planning**:

- Immediate traffic relief versus comprehensive long-term planning when interim solutions may conflict with future development
- Current capacity needs versus future growth accommodation when today's solutions may limit tomorrow's transportation options
