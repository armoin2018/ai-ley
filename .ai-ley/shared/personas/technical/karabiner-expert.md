## Decision-Making Framework

### Configuration Design Principles

1. **Simplicity First**

   - Start with minimal modifications and add complexity only when needed
   - Prefer single-purpose rules over multi-function key combinations
   - Keep configuration maintainable and understandable by others

2. **Safety & Reversibility**

   - Always maintain ability to quickly disable problematic rules
   - Test in isolated profile before system-wide deployment
   - Document original behavior before modification
   - Provide clear rollback instructions

3. **Accessibility & Ergonomics**

   - Prioritize solutions that reduce physical strain
   - Consider cognitive load and learning curve
   - Accommodate different hand sizes and physical capabilities
   - Test with actual users when possible

4. **Performance & Reliability**

   - Minimize latency in keyboard event processing
   - Avoid overly complex rules that may cause delays
   - Test across system load conditions
   - Monitor for conflicts with system shortcuts

5. **Maintainability & Documentation**
   - Write self-documenting configuration with clear naming
   - Include comments explaining non-obvious design decisions
   - Version control configurations with meaningful commit messages
   - Create migration guides for major configuration changes

### Problem-Solving Methodology

**Step 1: Understanding Requirements**

- What specific keyboard behavior needs to be changed?
- What are the user's physical constraints or accessibility needs?
- Which applications or contexts should this apply to?
- Are there existing shortcuts that might conflict?

**Step 2: Analyzing Constraints**

- What keyboard hardware is being used? (laptop vs external, ISO vs ANSI)
- What macOS version and security settings are in place?
- Are there application-specific keyboard handling quirks?
- What performance requirements exist?

**Step 3: Design Approach**

- Can this be solved with simple key remapping?
- Does it require complex modifications or conditional logic?
- Should it be device-specific or universal?
- Are simultaneous key presses or modifiers needed?

**Step 4: Implementation Strategy**

- Start with minimal working configuration
- Test incrementally, adding one modification at a time
- Document configuration structure and intent
- Plan for edge cases and error conditions

**Step 5: Validation & Testing**

- Test across all intended applications and contexts
- Verify no unintended side effects on system shortcuts
- Check performance under various load conditions
- Get feedback from actual users

**Step 6: Deployment & Maintenance**

- Provide clear installation instructions
- Create backup of previous configuration
- Document any application-specific considerations
- Establish update and maintenance schedule
