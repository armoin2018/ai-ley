# Instruction Review & Optimization System

## Variables

- Folders, Files and Indexes are stored in `{{folders.shared}}/folder-structure.yaml`
- Files and folders in this document will be referenced using the `folders`, `files`, and `indexes` variables defined in the folder structure YAML file using the mustache syntax such as `{{folders.plan}}`

## Objective

Systematically scan, analyze, and enhance all instruction files in `{{folders.instructions}}/**/*.md` to ensure they are accurate, comprehensive, and optimally structured for AI agent integration. This process includes automated scanning, quality assessment, content enhancement, and maintenance tracking.

## Phase 1: Discovery & Scanning

**Automated Directory Scan:**

1. **Inventory All Instructions**

   - Recursively scan `{{folders.instructions}}/**/*.md` for all instruction files
   - Generate a complete inventory with file paths, sizes, and last modified dates
   - Identify empty files, partial files, and potential duplicates
   - Check for orphaned files that don't follow naming conventions

2. **Structure Analysis**

   - Map the current folder hierarchy and categorization system
   - Identify gaps in coverage (missing domains, frameworks, or tools)
   - Analyze naming consistency and organizational patterns
   - Detect potential reorganization opportunities

3. **Content Scanning**
   - Perform initial content analysis for each file:
     - Word count and content density
     - Presence of required sections (purpose, skills, context, etc.)
     - Code examples and practical implementations
     - Cross-references to other instructions or personas
   - Flag files requiring immediate attention (empty, malformed, outdated references)

2. **Relevance & Utility Assessment**

   - Evaluate practical applicability in current AI agent workflows
   - Assess alignment with modern development practices and methodologies
   - Check for redundancy with other instructions or unnecessary overlap
   - Ensure content directly supports intended use cases
   - **Score: 1-5** (1 = Low relevance, 5 = Highly relevant and essential)

3. **Completeness & Detail Analysis**

   - Verify presence of all required sections per template standards
   - Assess depth of technical detail and practical guidance
   - Check for missing prerequisites, dependencies, or context
   - Evaluate example quality and comprehensiveness
   - **Score: 1-5** (1 = Incomplete or superficial, 5 = Comprehensive and detailed)

4. **AI Usability & Integration**

   - Ensure structure is machine-readable and consistently formatted
   - Verify tone is appropriate for AI processing (clear, directive, unambiguous)
   - Check for proper use of markdown formatting and sections
   - Assess compatibility with AI parsing and understanding
   - **Score: 1-5** (1 = Poor AI compatibility, 5 = Optimal for AI processing)

5. **Consistency & Standards Compliance**
   - Compare against template files in `{{folders.templates.instructions}}/`
   - Verify adherence to established naming conventions and folder structure
   - Check for consistent field names, formatting, and section ordering
   - Ensure proper cross-referencing and metadata inclusion
   - **Score: 1-5** (1 = Inconsistent format, 5 = Perfect template compliance)
