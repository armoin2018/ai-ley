Title: Phaser â€” AI Agent Game Dev Guide

Use cases
- 2D web games with canvas/WebGL; scenes, physics, and asset pipelines.

Patterns
- Scene state machines; fixed-update loops; asset preloading; input abstraction.
- Physics: Arcade vs. Matter.js; choose based on collision fidelity/perf.

Tooling
- TypeScript + vite; sprite atlases; tilemaps; audio formats.

AI Assistant Guidelines
- Generate minimal scene scaffolds with preload/create/update; include test harness.
- Optimize for mobile: texture sizes, input latency, and fixed timestep stability.
